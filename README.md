1. Supply backend a local directory path with arbitrarily nested markdown files
2. Start up frontend which will
    - Display all markdown files found in the given directory in a tree structure
    - Render selected markdown file to read it

Start backend and frontend in same terminal window:
1. `make start`

Or separately as:
1. `cd backend && python main.py`
2. `cd frontend && npm run dev`

### `example_dir/`


This directory contains a small set of files and directories to test the
application with.
It contains markdown files at varying levels in the file tree, alongside
other files.

This hopefully shows the (somewhat) intended purpose of this application where
you have a lot of repos with documentation (as markdown files) scattered about.
This application should make it a little bit nicer to navigate and discover
these markdown files to give you a better overview of where which bit of
documentation exists.

## To do

- [x] (**BE**) Add option (and probably as default) to ignore directories like
    `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.venv/`.
    - ðŸŸ  Partially done. Perhaps making this configurable would be nice
        as it is hardcoded right now
- [x] (**FE**) Make the loading/selected/fetching an MD file path based
    - i.e. now `{filepath: "dir_1/dir_2/file.md"}` is sent in a POST request
        make this a GET request with URL `[localhost:3030]/dir_1/dir_2/file.md`
    - This will make reloading the page have the expected behavior as well
    - Perhaps adding a button to clear the selected file would be nice
    - Also when refreshing the browser it would be nice if it didn't try to always
        fetch the file again (and list of files for the matter) each time but
        rather use some kind of cache we keep locally (in localStorage perhaps)
        such that we see some content faster!
    - ðŸŸ  Pretty much done except for using a cached version on browser reload,
        having a button to clear the selected file,
        and the file being visible in the file tree sidebar on browser reload
        (also it doesn't make a GET request either to fetch the file, should be fine though)
- [ ] (**BE/FE**) Investigate using WebSockets to be able receive updates from the server
    in case the markdown file tree has changed and when the current selected
    md file's content has changed, send the new state/version so it can be
    seamlessly updated in the frontend.
- [ ] (**FE**) After a browser reload with a path in the URL, e.g.
    `localhost:3000/path/to/file.md`, make sure the loaded file in revealed
    in the file-tree sidebar (i.e. the part of the tree leading to this file
    should be visible). Additionally when reloading with and additional header
    ID in the URL, e.g. `localhost:3000/path/to/file.md#_header2`, it should
    scroll to this header ID just as it would when clicking on an on-page header
    from the right-sidebar when the content is already loaded.
- [ ] (**FE**) Make [GitHub task lists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists) display properly
- [ ] (**FE**) Add a search functionality to quickly find and select a file
    - This can be done in the sidebar or in a modal popup, the latter will probably feel nicer
